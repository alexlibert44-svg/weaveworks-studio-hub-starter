- Palette lives in semantic `src/styles.css` tokens (purple, light blue, white, neutral, error red); never green/yellow.
- `device_id` columns hold `auth.uid()::text`; RLS checks it. Why: reuse queries without renames.
- Schedules are written only by `complete_review_session` (adaptive: accuracy + timing); triggers block client writes. Why: deterministic, never AI.
- Avatars: private `avatars` bucket at `<uid>/...`, signed URLs. Why: public buckets blocked.
- SignatureFrame on Home/Review/Profile; shared LanguageSelector (body portal, own scroll) on Home/Settings.
- Scope sets/reviews/stats/streaks by `target_language`. Why: languages stay isolated.
- Learning-data rules: see `src/lib/verba/AGENTS.md`.
- Freemium: `src/lib/verba/plan.ts` is the single entitlement source; Premium UI and tap-triggered gates use `usePlan` + `PremiumGate`. Why: real billing/server enforcement plugs in there later.
- Completed training sessions retain their points when a word set is deleted; the session foreign key uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`. Why: earned totals are permanent history.
- Language selectors derive localized language and country labels from `Intl.DisplayNames` using the app/native locale. Why: labels stay standardized and independent of the learning language.
- Backend is Lovable Cloud; schema, RLS, review/training functions and guard triggers were rebuilt from the documented rules in `src/lib/verba/AGENTS.md`. Why: the original database's SQL was not available.
